## üìñ Project Overview

Welcome to the **DEEPFAKE DETECTION SYSTEM**! This project aims to detect deepfake videos using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing video frames and audio signals, our system can identify manipulated content with high accuracy.

## ‚ú® Features

- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes state-of-the-art models for deepfake detection.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Processes videos in real-time for immediate results.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for uploading and analyzing videos.
- **Scalable:** Capable of handling large datasets and multiple video formats.

## üìÖ Future Updates & Plans

- **Enhanced Model Accuracy:** Continuous improvement of detection algorithms.
- **Mobile Application:** Development of a mobile app for on-the-go analysis.
- **Cloud Integration:** Integration with cloud services for scalable processing.
- **Community Contributions:** Encourage contributions to expand and improve the system.
